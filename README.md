To learn about the git collaboration

- 'git clone <url>': Downloads the repository from the web to your local computer 
 - make sure you dont nest this command into another repository
 - just like 'git init', only do this once per repo
 
- 'git branch <branch name>': create a new branch where HEAD is
	- 'git branch -a': list all the branches
- 'git switch <branch name>' : move to branch
